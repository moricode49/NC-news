# NC News

Created and hosted a full-stack CRUD news aggregation application with user interaction features such as content rating and adding comments on articles. 

I built a backend service including a RESTful API with Express using a PostgreSQL database and utilising Node.js to provide information to the front-end architecture. 

This was created using React, utilising components to sort the routing, grouping articles by topics for example, and ensuring users can only make changes to the database where they are permitted.
